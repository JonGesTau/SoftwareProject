stuff left to do:
- TODO s
- make sure tie is dealt with during minimax
V stop checking ptr!=NULL before freeing
- error handling:
  - remember to deal with SDL
  - print error if there is
  - clear all memory if something messes up!


XML UNIT:
- saving tested successfully, need to address TODOs though
- loading also tested

Console unit:
- print board was tested

Game board:
- legal move tested for: all pieces
- isThreatened also works
- allmoves seems good too
- tested for check and mate

minimax:
- tested scoring function

Status:
* xMl unit:
    - only TODOs to clean
* console unit:
    - only print board works
* logic unit:
    - do mate check
    - chain possible moves for min/max
    - test these

* consider avoiding boolean parameters in gameState, doesn't really mean anything anyway
