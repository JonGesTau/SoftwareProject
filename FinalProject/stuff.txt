XML UNIT:
- saving tested successfully, need to address TODOs though

Console unit:
- print board was tested

Game board:
- legal move tested for: all pieces
- isThreatened also works
- next: make sure check works

* how do we return the move from minimax? create perhaps move struct with chars y1,x1,y2,x2?

* how do we parse the XML? perhaps use external lib?

* when scanning moves during the minimax, it's kinda shit doing all the loops for possible moves and then each time
  repeating the recursion code. one possible way is to first scan all possible moves and keep in linked list.
  we can try to do it together with the bonus feature, but the bonus feature has to include the extra information
  about the threatened status of the square...

* perhaps we should split isCheck to create: isThreatenedSquare/Piece
